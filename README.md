# Deep_Learning-_Projects

This repository showcases a collection of deep learning projects focused on computer vision techniques. The projects and notes are part of my "Computer Vision for Deep Learning" course from Neuralearn, providing a comprehensive understanding of modern deep learning methodologies applied to visual data.

Course Overview
TensorFlow & Tensors:
Introduction to TensorFlow and its foundational concepts.

Practical experience working with tensors, including ragged tensors, and performing tensor operations.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
In-depth exploration of CNN architecture, including convolutional layers, pooling, and activation functions.

Implementation of CNNs for tasks such as image classification and object detection.

Advanced Deep Learning Architectures:
Examination of well-known deep learning models, including:

LeNet

MobileNet

ResNet

EfficientNet

VGG

AlexNet

Performance comparisons and analysis of the most suitable architectures for specific use cases.

Projects:
Car Price Prediction:

Developed a regression model to predict car prices based on various features and trained it on a relevant dataset.

Malaria Disease Classification:

Collected and preprocessed data, then trained a deep learning model to classify malaria-infected versus healthy cells.

Applied techniques like data augmentation and model regularization to combat overfitting, and utilized the Keras API for model implementation.

Human Emotion Detection:

Built a model to classify human emotions based on facial expressions.

Leveraged transfer learning, fine-tuning, and Hugging Face transformers for enhanced model performance.

Conducted both black-box and white-box testing to validate the model's predictions and layer operations.

Transformers in Computer Vision:
Implemented transformer models for tasks like image classification and image generation, exploring fine-tuning techniques for pre-trained models.

MLOps Workflow:
Focused on efficient management of machine learning workflows with:

Dataset and model versioning.

Experiment tracking via Wandb.

Cloud deployment and testing of models.

Model Quantization:
Gained experience in model optimization for edge devices using techniques like post-training quantization and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT).

YOLO v2 (You Only Look Once):
In-depth theoretical and practical application of the YOLO v2 object detection architecture.

Developed custom loss functions, Non-Maximum Suppression, and implemented Intersection over Union (IoU) for model evaluation.

Image Generation & Generative Models:
Investigated image generation techniques using:

Variational Autoencoders (VAE)

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

Created projects including generating handwritten digits with VAE and realistic celebrity faces using DCGAN and the CelebA dataset.

Key Takeaways:
This course has equipped me with a deep understanding of computer vision techniques, enabling me to apply theoretical concepts to real-world applications. Through hands-on projects, I have honed my skills in building, deploying, and optimizing deep learning models while managing workflows with MLOps tools.
